Hey Giada (and Shawn),

Here's a baseline model.  I've also included an example runscript, so you can see how to call it.  The "atlast_noise.pro" has a header, and is fairly well commented, so you can see what inputs and outputs are.  The file "noise_routines.pro" contains all the sub-routines that the noise model calls.  For now,  do me a favor and keep these pieces of code between the three of us.

Here's what I set in the call to atlast_noise:

Ahr - high-resolution planetary geometric albedo
lamhr - wavelength grid for Ahr (um)
alpha - phase angle (deg)
Phi - phase function (applied at alpha)
Rp - planet radius (in Earth radii)
r - planet semi-major axis (AU)
Teff - stellar effective temperature (K)
Rs - stellar radius (in solar radii)
d - distance to the system (pc)
Nez - number of exo-zodi in system
diam - telescope diameter (m)
C - raw contrast
lammin, lammax - min and max wavelengths covered (um)
Res - spectral resolution
Tput - throughput
IWA, OWA - inner and outer working angles (in lambda/D)
Tsys - system/telescope temperature (K)
emis - system/telescope emissivity

Here's what I'm currently setting in the model:
De - dark current (e-/s)
DNHpix - horizontal spread of spectrum (in # of pixels)
Re - read noise per pixel
Dtmax - maximum exposure time (s; limited by cosmic ray hits)
X - size of aperture placed over planet (in lambda/D)
q - quantum efficiency of detector

Note that at line 146 in atlast_noise.pro, I've added a thermal contribution from the telescope.  I didn't think too hard about this, so you should check if it's right.  Email me if you find an error there.

Cheers!
